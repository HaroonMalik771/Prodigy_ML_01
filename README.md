## Implementation Details

### Libraries Used
- `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: Data manipulation and visualization
- `SimpleImputer` from `sklearn`: Handling missing data
- `StandardScaler` and `LabelEncoder` from `sklearn`: Data preprocessing
- `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`: Splitting the dataset
-  regression models from `sklearn` and 

### Workflow

- **Data Loading**: Loaded the training and testing datasets from Kaggle.
- **Handling Missing Data**: Identified and handled missing data in the dataset using imputation techniques.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Scaled numerical features using Standard Scaler and encoded categorical features using Label Encoder.
- **Prediction**: Used the linear  Regression  model to predict house prices on the test dataset.

### Conclusion

The  Redression modelis used   for house price prediction. The project includes comprehensive data handling, preprocessing, and model evaluation steps.
